    </p>
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

        <li>½ cup cooking oil</li>

        <li>1 ½ cups chopped onion</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>

        <li>1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh ginger root</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt. 
            Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides. 
            Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, 
            and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; 
            allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring.
        </li>
    </ol>
